<p>Imagine you have a standard deck of playing cards in front of you. Someone tells you to draw a card. You oblige, and pull the Eight of Diamonds off the top. They tell you to draw again. The Six of Hearts. Draw Again. Three of Clubs.</p>
<p>I’d like to ask you a question – at this point, are you having any fun?</p>
<p>Drawing cards is a crucial part to any card game. After all, how else would you play cards if you couldn’t draw them from a deck?</p>
<p>You often start a card game by drawing an initial set of cards. From here, a card game may have a ruleset that allows players to draw additional cards, or the card amount is set.</p>
<p>In many card games, card draw is a powerful effect that allows a player to take more cards from their deck, giving them more playing options, like in Magic the Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon, or Hearthstone. If you can draw more cards, then you can play more creatures or cast more spells, and have a stronger position on the board state.</p>
<p>However, in games like Uno, card draw is a punishment. The objective of Uno is to play and remove cards from your hand until you have no cards remaining. If you are unable to perform an action in a certain way (play a card matching the color or rank of the previous card in Uno), you must draw a card. If you find yourself on the receiving end of a Draw 4 card, then you must draw four cards from the deck. Card draw here means that you are further from your objective of removing cards from your hand and winning.</p>
<p>In many card games, card draw is neither a punishment nor a boon – it’s simply how to start playing the game. Once the initial hand is drawn, no more cards can be drawn by anyone. This is the case for many poker games such as Texas Hold’em or for Cribbage. Some poker games, like five card draw, allow players to discard their hand in order to draw more cards. However, this is not seen as an advantage, as all players have this option available to them.</p>
<p>Another example to look at would be card based roguelike games like Slay the Spire. In Slay the Spire, you play a character that has a deck of cards, with each card representing</p>
<p>Let’s go back to your hand of cards. Was drawing these cards any fun? Perhaps you were thinking about the next card making a pair with some of your cards in hand, or you were deducing that we were not playing Blackjack after you drew a third card. However, without any context or knowledge of what game we’re playing, drawing cards in and of themselves does not offer a lot of enjoyment. You might find a person sitting by themselves with a deck of cards playing a game of Solitaire, but how often do you find a person sitting with a deck of cards drawing cards one by one?</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re playing an Exodia deck in Yu-Gi-Oh – you just took a beating from your opponent and you’re at 2000 LP. You have four pieces of Exodia in your hand. There are 12 cards remaining in your deck. You go to draw – your heart pumps. Unless you draw the right card, you may be facing certain defeat next turn. If you are lucky, you’ll beat the 8.33% odds and draw the last piece of Exodia, winning the duel right there. Or maybe you’ll draw the Pot of Greed spell, which allows you to draw another 2 cards. Now, instead of drawing 1 card for the turn, you’ll draw 3 cards.</p>
<p>Compare that experience with a tense game of Uno. You’re playing with your family after Thanksgiving dinner and you’re on a roll. You only have two more cards in your hand – a green 7 and a Wild Card. You’re planning your next turn in your head when your brother next to you slams the Draw Four card on the table. Egads! Your vision of victory fades away as your hand grows from two cards into six cards.</p>
