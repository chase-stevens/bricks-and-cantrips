        <p>I have played Hearthstone since before the beta, putting together decks in tabletop simulator-esque programs and playing with the known cards before finally getting my hands on some real packs. It’s a juggernaut of a card game, breaking the mold on how players and the industry thought about collectible card games.</p>
<h2 id="forge">Forge</h2>
<p>Forge is a mechanic from a recent set of Hearthstone cards called TITAN. It shows up on a few cards as an optional cost of 2 mana to give a bonus effect to the card when cast. While the card with Forge is in your hand, you can drag it over to your deck to pay 2 mana to forge it. When you do, the card goes back into your hand with new artwork and the bonus effect added to the body of the card.</p>
<p>The benefit gained from paying the Forge cost is typically powerful. For example, Cyclopian Crusher is a creature for 3 mana with a 3/3 statline and rush (can attack the turn it’s played, except for the enemy hero). However, if you forge it, it gets an additional +3/+2 of stats when it’s played. If you draw it when you’re at full mana and you forge it, you’re basically playing it as a 5 mana 5/6 with rush. However, if you have this in your opening hand and you think you can get away with not affecting the board on turn two, then you can forge this on turn two and then slam it on turn three to turn the tide of battle.</p>
<p>To me, Forge feels like a really fun mechanic. Each forge card gives you a little quest – you could play it as it is, but wouldn’t it be that much more fun to forge it first? The mechanic benefits from the digital medium as well. The forge animation of the hammer hitting the card is a lot of fun, and replacing the original art with new art that shows the upgraded card effect adds to the payoff. Forge is interesting from a gameplay perspective as well. Your card now gives you a choice to make – do you play it as it is early on, or do you forge it and see if the investment will pay off?</p>
<h2 id="cthun">C’Thun</h2>
<p>C’Thun is an Old God – a scary Lovecraftian being, evil beyond our comprehension with a cult of minions ready to do its bidding. C’Thun itself is a 10 mana 6/6 minion with a battlecry that does damage equal to its attack randomly to enemies. Each point of damage is a randomly targeted ping. On its own, this minion would be overcosted and not see play, but luckily for C’Thun, it has its own minions that help out.</p>
<p>The C’Thun themed minions have average to slightly good statlines with a unique effect – they buff your C’Thun card for the match. Beckoner of Evil is the most straightforward example. it’s a 2 mana 2/3 with the battlecry “Give your C’Thun +2+2 (wherever it is).” This effect buffs your C’Thun card anywhere – on your side of the battlefield, in your hand, or even in your deck. For flavor, when your C’Thun is buffed, it makes a brief appearance in the game and shares a discouraging message to your opponent. The experience doesn’t affect the game state at all but it’s a super fun and flavorful UI element that takes advantage of Hearthstone’s digital medium and makes you feel like you’re leading your own personal C’Thun cult.</p>
<p>Buffing your C’Thun on the board is okay, but this really shines when you haven’t played C’Thun yet. Instead of doing 6 points of damage when it comes into play, C’Thun has 8 attack instead of 6, and now it will do 8 points of damage on the board. A 10 mana 8/8 that does 8 points of damage is a little better, but C’Thun is a build around card, and you have a lot of turns to play buffing minions. When you finally have the mana to summon C’Thun, you could easily have a 20/20 creature that clears the enemies board, or if you’re already winning on board, does 20 damage directly to your opponent’s face.</p>
<p>There are other cards synergize with C’Thun as well, like creatures that gain benefits when your C’Thun is at 10 attack, or tutors that allow you to draw your C’Thun from your deck.</p>
<h2 id="hero-powers">Hero Powers</h2>
<p>Hero Powers in Hearthstone are one of the iconic mechanics that make the game what it is. Each class in Hearthstone has a Hero Power, which is an ability that can be activated once per turn for two mana. It’s important to note that the Hero Power is not tied to a card. With Hearthstone’s mana consistently growing and a Hero Power that can be activated whenever, the Hero Power means you always have something to do by turn two.</p>
<p>For some classes, the hero power is a nice to have to use your mana, while other classes live and die by their hero power. The Warrior class has a hero power to gain 2 armor for 2 mana. It’s a nice way to use your mana if your hand is a little awkward or if you don’t have anything else to play. The Warlock class, on the other hand, has one of the most powerful hero powers in the game – pay 2 mana and 2 life to draw a card. This powerful hero power adds fuel to the fire for aggro Warlock decks, and lets control Warlock decks keep their hand full to answer any threats that might arise.</p>
<h2 id="singleton-payoff-aka-highlander-and-reno-jackson">Singleton Payoff aka Highlander and Reno Jackson</h2>
<p>One mechanic that Hearthstone has been able to implement and enforce with ease is the singleton deck design. There are a series of cards that have powerful benefits, but they can only be activated if you don’t have any duplicates of any cards in your deck (keeping in mind that Hearthstone has 30 card decks with two copies maximum). An unofficial term for the mechanic is “Highlander,” since “there can only be one” (copy of each card in your deck).</p>
<p>More than twenty cards have Highlander effects, but the one I want to call out is the first and perhaps most iconic card, Reno Jackson.</p>
<p>Reno Jackson is one of the first original Hearthstone characters to be introduced, and has gone on to grace many cards since (and even made his way into World of Warcraft). His first card, and the first Highlander card, is a 6 mana 4/6 with the text “Battlecry: If your deck has no duplicates, fully heal your hero.” A key card in control decks, he provided the perfect buffer to stabilize against aggro players and stay in the game.</p>
<p>As I was looking through old articles about the game, I was reminded that a card that heals the player to full existed before Reno Jackson. The Druid class has a card called Tree of Life that was introduced in the first expansion pack. The card is a 9 mana spell with the text “Restore all characters to full life.” However, this expensive spell didn’t see much play, if at all. Comparing it to Reno Jackson, we can see many differences, like the expensive cost and the symmetric effect. Reno Jackson also comes in as a minion that affects the board state. The two key differences that I want to highlight, however, come down to the cost of designing a deck with single copies of cards and the ability to put Reno into any deck, as opposed to being a class exclusive. This powerful card with this crazy tradeoff was able to be put into any possible deck in the game – you had an awesome deck building challenge in front of you with a great reward for doing it right.</p>
<h2 id="discover">Discover</h2>
<p>Discover is a keyword in Hearthstone that means you can choose between one of three eligible cards to add to your hand. The card choices available to you are determined by the text of the original card. For example, Stonehill Defender allows you to Discover a Taunt Minion, while Primordial Glyph allows you to Discover a Spell. It’s a fun way to gain cards without simply drawing from your deck, and in a way that’s only possible in a digital medium.</p>
