Welcome! I hope you found it okay.

I would like to introduce you to Bricks & Cantrips, a blog dedicated to game design within card games. Popular topics will run the gamut from stalwarts of the genre like Magic the Gathering and Slay the Spire to the classics like Poker and Uno. If it has cards and is a game, we can take a look.

What is it about card games that makes them so fun to play? That is what weâ€™d like to find out.

If you want to invite me to your Uno RPG playtesting sessions, or ask me any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me at [chasestevenspersonal+bricks@gmail.com](mailto:chasestevenspersonal+bricks@gmail.com). Thanks so much for reading, and I hope you find a post or two that helps you enjoy card games more than you did before.
